Max Token
Tokens can be thought of as pieces of words. Before the API processes the prompts, the input is broken down into tokens.

Each model has a maximum number of tokens. Select the number of tokens depending on the length of the response you want to get and the selected model.

Organization ID (OpenAI)
The organization ID information only applies to OpenAI and allows you to select the organization with which you will be using your API Key

Query Language
Select the language in which you will work the interactions with the API. For functionalities such as Explain or Document, each query will be made in the selected language.

Temperature
This is a parameter that can be adjusted. It determines the level of randomness or "creativity" in the generated text. A higher temperature will result in more varied and creative output, while a lower temperature will produce output that is more similar to the training data and less likely to contain unexpected or surprising content.

It is a value between 0 and 1. 0 being the most deterministic and 1 being the most random and creative. The default temperature is 0.3
